# dns-blocklists

This repository contains the Ansible playbook that we use to generate DNS based blocking files for our Encrypted DNS, and VPN server __(also known as VPN relay)__ based DNS blocking.

This is imported to our VPN servers frequently.

We aim to update these lists on a weekly basis. You can view the latest update by selecting the commits to this repository.

# Why is list "X" not included?

If you find a block list that is included it is because we have gone through these validation steps:
- The blocklist is an amalgamation of other blocklists.
- The blocklist no longer maintained.
- The blocklist blocks things we do not believe should be blocked (like our own domains).

We periodically make exceptions to the included URLs for the following reasons:
- The upstream lists are broken and include malformed URLs causing the generation to fail.
- The upstream lists block our domains.

# Using Encrypted DNS on Apple Devices

For convenience we have Apple configuration profiles (.mobileconfig) signed for simpler "one-click installation", or MDM management.

These are available here: https://github.com/mullvad/encrypted-dns-profiles

# Differences between VPN servers and Encrypted DNS

Please note that our Encrypted DNS service includes different hostnames for each option. We currently offer the following:
- Vanilla:
  - This includes zero blocking, purely encrypted DNS for TLS and HTTPs.
  - TLS: dns.mullvad.net
  - HTTPS: https://dns.mullvad.net/dns-query
- Ad-block:
  - This includes Ad-blocking and Tracker blocking for TLS and HTTPS. The lists are what are found in this repository.
  - TLS: adblock.dns.mullvad.net
  - HTTPS: https://adblock.dns.mullvad.net/dns-query
- Base:
  - This includes Ad-blocking, Tracker, and Malware blocking for TLS and HTTPS. The lists are what are found in this repository.
  - TLS: base.dns.mullvad.net
  - HTTPS: https://base.dns.mullvad.net/dns-query  
- Extended:
  - This includes Ad-blocking, Tracker, Malware and Social Media blocking for TLS and HTTPS. The lists are what are found in this repository.
  - TLS: extended.dns.mullvad.net
  - HTTPS: https://extended.dns.mullvad.net/dns-query
- All:
  - This includes Ad-blocking, Tracker, Malware, Adult content, Gambling and Social Media blocking for TLS and HTTPS. The lists are what are found in this repository.
  - TLS: all.dns.mullvad.net
  - HTTPS: https://all.dns.mullvad.net/dns-query

Note that social media block lists are **not** available on our VPN server block lists, they are **only** available on the Encrypted DNS service.

# Lists

The following lists are what we import to our service. You can find these defined in `inventory/group_vars` for the server type you wish to view.

- `doh`: Encrypted DNS servers
- `relay`: VPN servers (relays)

## Pull requests / Issues / Updating block lists

We prefer to not block individual custom URLs or add block lists without them being fully validated and verified first. Please consider pointing us toward a reputable block list prior to making a Github Issue. 

If we close your issue or reject your request, it is most likely down to us not having a way of verifying that the block list is trustworthy.

# Building

The following steps are useful only if you wish to build the lists yourself.

The output files located in `output/relay/` are what are imported onto our VPN servers.

## Requirements
- Ansible Core 2.14.x =<
- Qubes OS DispVM

## Step by step

  - Ensure the values in `group_vars/<group>.yml` are up to date with any block lists
  - Ensure the values in `scripts/generate_social_blocklists_urls` and `scripts/generate_social_blocklists_asn.py` are up to date (URLs and ASNs)
  - Start a DisposibleVM (dispVM) and `qvm-copy` this repository to it
  - Ensure the script in `scripts/generate_social_blocklists.sh` has been run: `cd scripts/ && ./generate_social_blocklists.sh` in a Disposible VM (dispVM) with the output qvm-copied to files/social (`cp /tmp/social files/social`)
  - Ensure you have added any 'custom' extra lists or websites to block
  - Run the playbook to generate the lists:
    - `ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbook.yml`
    - `ansible-playbook -i inventory/ playbook.yml --tags=readme` can be used to generate the README on its own
  - View the output (once pushed) at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mullvad/dns-blocklists/main/output/<group>.txt?raw=true`
  - Run test script: `cd scripts && ./check_zonedata.sh`
  - Sign the outputted relay files with your GPG code signing key, for example:
    - `for list in adblock adult privacy gambling social; do gpg2 --detach-sign --armor output/relay/relay_${list}.txt > output/relay/relay_${list}.txt.gpg; done && for list in adblock adult privacy gambling social; do gpg2 --detach-sign --armor output/relay/relay_${list}.zone > output/relay/relay_${list}.gpg; done`
  - Verify the outputted GPG signed files, for example:
    - `for list in adblock adult privacy gambling social; do echo "Verify: ${list}" && gpg2 --verify output/relay/relay_${list}.txt.gpg output/relay/relay_${list}.txt; done && for list in adblock adult privacy gambling social; do echo "Verify: ${list}" && gpg2 --verify output/relay/relay_${list}.gpg output/relay/relay_${list}.zone; done`
